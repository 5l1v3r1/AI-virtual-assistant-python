# AI virtual assitant 


It is a terminal-based virtual assistant especially made for competitive programming. It has a lot of features, including running python or c++ file, parsing problem set with test cases and test against all the cases in one click, test with brute force solution, and many more. It will help you to boost your programming skill and help you to do a good performance in the programming contest.

It can give voice reply and take your voice command. You can turn off or on these features. Basic settings can be easily changed from settings.py file.
